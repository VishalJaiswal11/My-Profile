 <h2><b> History  Of Swargadwari Temple:</b></h3>
 <p>
    Swargadwari hold lots of belief among Hindu devotees, which have the special honor of the role of Cows in Hinduism. People of Pyuthan district believe Guru Maharaj Narayan Khatri often called Swami Hamsananda found the Swargadwari temple. In the earlier days, cow grazing was the main occupation of the people in the Pyuthan district. According to the traditional stories and locals, guru Maharaj dug the land and found curd mixed with rice and fire. Then he explained to the locals that the Pandavs buried these things. Then people decide to build a Temple in that places. The fire from the ground has been burning until now. Not only that the holy fire cures disorders aches in the body.  
 <br><br><br>
 Another history of Swargadwari arises from the Rolpa. Narayan Gautama was a leprosy patient. He arrived at Swargadwari temple and started living there. He was also practicing yoga and meditation. After that, his leprosy was slowly cured. Therefore, he started the sacrificial fire on the full moon day on the month of Bishak, which is burning until today. People entitled Narayan Gautama as a yogi and he also establish an ashram to graze cows. The ashram has been home to more than 300 cows until today.

 People also believe that there was a person named Swargadwari Mahapravu who was god-sent to restore and protect the Dharma in today’s world. He followed the footsteps of guru Maharaj. Therefore, he spent his entire life doing yoga and taking care of the cows. He even took his last breath on the very spot where guru Maharaj was buried.

    Another road to Swargadwari temple is from Ghorahi to Swargadwari. This is a harder road, which takes about 7 to 8 hours. The trek begins from Kathmandu to Dang, which goes through a cement factory. The road is almost packed every day because of the trippers. Because of that, the road seems dusty and bumpy so you should prepare yourself for this.  The bus will stop you right at the bus park in Dharmapani on the left side of the ashram. From here, you can explore the ashram.  From the ashram, you will have to walk to bit.
