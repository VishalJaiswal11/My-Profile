    <h1 id="title">My Experiences Upto 12th </h1> <hr>
    <p id=intro>Namaskar,<br> My name is Vishal Jaiswal. I was born on <b>20 August 2002,</b>
    at a very small village Khurhuriya at barhni block of district Siddharth Nagar in U.P.,India 
    We are three brothers and two sisters.My father does agriculture. I feel very very proud that i was born on the lap of <i>BHARAT MATA.</i>
</p><br>
<p>
    I want to share my educational Experiences upto class 12th: I completed my early education from my parents and a private
    school named ,<b><i>Shreemati Shyama Devi Shishu Mandir</i></b> and junior school <b><i>"Vijay Surya Bal Vidya Mandir"</i></b> located at 1 km away from my hoiuse at village Dudhawaniya Khurd.
    There had very beautiful memories and I wish that days come again.There were 60 students,I had good friendship with me and everyone.
    Everyone had alot of fun,eating together and live happily with the support of teachers. 
</p> <br>
<p> The most important thing about this school was that along with education,emphasis was given on the all around development of children.
    I still remember that I did many different roles in various cultural events like Annual Function,National festivals etc.
    I had played the role of LAKSHMANA in Ramayan Episodes,comic roles,in singing group dancing and acting also. I learned
    a lot from this school and the art of living life.
